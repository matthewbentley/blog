The data was generated using ode113 in matlab on a 12 core server, with a time step dt = 0.001 and dr = 0.01.  The inital condition is (x, y, z) = (5, 5, 5).  The raw data consists of three text files taking up about 1.8GB each, and was then animated using matlab on my laptop and compressed using ffmpeg.
