Dear LinkedIn users,

Many of us created a LinkedIn account in High School or college, after being
told we would need it to eventually find a job. We carefully went through all
the profile fields, filling it in where we had applicable experience, leaving
most of it blank. As college progressed, we slowly fillet it out with clubs,
fraternity and sorority leadership, internships, service, and more, until we
graduated and added our first real job.

At the same time, we started adding connections. We connected with high school
friends, hackathon teammates, and significant others. As we filled in our
profile with real work experience, we connected with co-workers, managers,
recruiters, and more.

This all felt meaningful and productive. It was a cross between a resume and a
social network. The connections felt real, endorsements meant something, and we
felt that we could actually use it to find a job.

Eventually, the company had to make money. So paid features were added. We
wanted to send a message to somebody we do not know? That will be $5/month. Want
to see who viewed your profile? $30/month. If you wanted to use it to hire for
your new business? $100/month.

Of course, the company needs to make money. And many web services struggle with
this. We just have a problem with the dark patterns that have begun to emerge.
It should have been a bad sign when they asked to import our contacts when we
signed up. Now one can never be sure whether hitting “Connect with
fuzzyballetgirl57@yahoo.com” will send an invitation to their LinkedIn account,
or an email to their yahoo account saying “Your friend invited you to join
LinkedIn!”

Now, LinkedIn feels more like a tool for recruiters, and we users only keep our
profiles up to date because we need it to get a job.

I asked a few friends what they use LinkedIn for, and most of the answers were
along the lines of “fear of missing out” or “because my profile is on the first
page when I Google my name”. None of them said they used it to get a job.

Of course, being in software makes it easier to say all this. We all have GitHub
accounts, personal websites, and half a dozen Slack teams and IRC channels we
can connect with. I really do not know how well liked or disliked LinkedIn is in
other fields. I would like to hear opinions on this issue from people in various
fields.

For all these reasons, we (the people who are listed below as signing) will
delete our LinkedIn accounts. We do not feel that they bring significant value
to our careers, and the overhead of maintenance is not worth the effort.

Sincerely,
