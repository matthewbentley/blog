_This writing is inspired by the beginning of the book Leviathan Wakes, which
I just started reading._

Imagine you grew up in space. Not just on Mars or the Moon, but in _space_
space. You were born on a space station. You spent most of your childhood
underground in an asteroid, with artificial gravity created by the asteroid
spinning.

You grew up always in an enclosed space. Your street was a tunnel, slightly
curved upward. Your house was built into the rock.

It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t exactly luxury. You, and everyone you
knew, breathed recycled air, drank recycled water. You are accustomed to the
constant white noise of the environment control systems. If the sounds were to
ever stop, you would know that something was seriously wrong.

Once or twice you took vacations to Mars, or maybe some of the bigger space
stations. Those had a sky, with a contained atmosphere. But even then, there was
always the dome overhead. Looking up, you could see the lattice of the support
structures.

No matter where you went, you lived with the constant thought of what if. What
if the barriers broke. What if the air rushed out into space. The walls and
domes and high tech lattices were a comfort, keeping you safe from the emptiness
of space.

One day, you find yourself on a passenger vessel to Earth. The purpose of your
journey is not important. Maybe it’s business; maybe it’s pleasure; maybe your
great aunt Agnes died and you need to go to her funeral to get your share of the
inheritance.

Whatever it is, you’ve never been to Earth before.

Humanity’s home planet starts as a pale blue dot on the horizon. As the days
pass, it becomes a larger blue dot, then a blue green marble, and slowly the
continents start to take shape.

It is more spectacular than any of the photographs you have seen. You see the
white show of the poles; the yellow brown of the desserts, not rusty red like on
Mars; the green of the rainforests; the deep blue of the oceans; and most
stunningly the web of lights of the cities of Earth, spread over the whole
globe.

Atmospheric entry is not too bad, compared to the extremes of growing up past
the asteroid belt.

You’ve heard about the sky: how big it is, how empty it seems, how there seems
to be nothing between you and space. You’re slightly skeptical. It can’t be that
much to take in, compared to the experiences of outer space.

You probably land somewhere in Kansas. That seems like a good place to put
a space port.

And then you step outside.

Nothing could prepare you for what you experience.

The sky truly is vast, and it’s suffocating. There is nothing between you and
the vacuum of space, other than the gravity of Earth holding in the flimsy
atmosphere. The sky has no right to be so blue and happy.

You feel the wind on your face. Of course you’ve felt a breeze before; any
station that’s large enough has one. But this air is so crisp and clean. It
hasn’t been recycled a hundred times by artificial scrubbers. You can almost
taste the photosynthesis that transmuted it from deadly CO2 to breathable air,
thousands of miles away.

And the sounds. There’s no constant hum, only the whistle of the wind and the
bustle of people coming and going from the space port.

To break the fourth wall and step away from the second person, I don’t know what
the purpose of that was. While reading _Leviathan Wakes_, I simply had the
though of what being on Earth for the first time must be like for a person who
had spent their life under domes and behind walls.

I was tempted to use it as a metaphor, and compare it to something I’ve
experienced in my life. But I don’t think there is any experience that could
live up to what I described.

I guess we’ll just have to explore the stars and find out.
