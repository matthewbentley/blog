I just got my newest toy: the USB Armory by Inverse Path.  Rather then me tell
you about it, I'll let the creators do that: <!--more--><br />

It has 512mb of ram, a Cortex A8 800Mhz CPU, and uses a micro SD card for
storage.

[Here](http://inversepath.com/usbarmory) is the official website, and
[here](https://www.crowdsupply.com/inverse-path/usb-armory) is the Crowd Supply
project (which already ended).

I just got mine yesterday, and will spend some time using it and update you on
the progress.
