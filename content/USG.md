Almost four months ago, I decided to run an exec position on the Case Western
Reserve University (CWRU) Undergraduate Student Government (USG).

The current Vice President of Information Technology was stepping down for
a semester long internship (also called a co-op), and the General Assembly (GA)
needed to elect a replacement for the semester. On the recommendation of one of
my fraternity brothers, I decided to go for it. I showed up to Adelbert on
a snowy Tuesday night, delivered a three minute pitch (speech) about why the
representatives should vote for me, answered a few questions, and stepped out of
the room to allow the other candidates to do the same. I did not think I would
win, given that the other two candidates were on the IT committee, and I knew
almost nothing about the USG. After long deliberation, I was invited back into
the room and welcomed with “congratulations VP Bentley”. I had won, and thus
started a semester long journey into the inner workings of Case Western Reserve
University.

The USG
===
The Undergraduate Student Government has two primary purposes: advocate to the
administration on behalf of the student body, and recognize and fund student
groups. The funding comes from the student activity fee (SAF), a $171 charge
that is added to tuition to fund student activities. This comes out to a bit
more than $800,000 per semester, of which the USG gets about 23%, or about
$200,000.

The USG is composed of the General Assembly, the Executive Committee, and five
other committees. The General Assembly is everyone, is chaired by the USG’s
speaker, and has the authority to vote on resolutions, recognize or de-recognize
student organizations, and overturn decisions by any committee. The executive
committee is chaired by the president, and is made up of the student body
president, the five vice presidents, the Chief Judicial Officer (CJO), the
secretary, speaker, and treasurers, and is tasked with setting the direction of
the USG. The five VPs each lead their respective committees: Student Life,
Academic Affairs, Finance, Information Technology (IT), and Public Relations
(PR). Student Life, Academic Affairs, all advocate to the administration
regarding topics relevant to that committee. Finance is responsible for running
the day to day business of allocating money to student organizations (and the
treasurers deal with the paperwork from that). And PR works to get the word out
about what USG is doing and conduct surveys of undergraduate students.

IT
---
In January, I was elected Vice President of IT. This means I would lead the IT
committee, make sure the [USG website](http://usg.case.edu) stays mostly
working, serve on the USG executive committee, and regularly meet with
administrators in Information Technology Services (ITS) and in other IT roles.

I have learned and done a lot as VP of IT. Right off the bat, I had to quickly
learn how to run a committee meeting and help representatives do their jobs.
Additionally, I found myself setting up a monthly meeting with the university’s
Vice President of IT and Chief Information Officer, as well as several other
administrators. I get to carry through on work started before I joined USG, such
as efforts to improve campus Wifi and update department websites. And next week,
I get to meet with the Faculty Senate Committee on Undergraduate Education
(FSCUE)to ask for a database dump of course evaluations.

To The Point
===
So why am I writing this blog post? Well, for two primary reasons, the second of
which I’ll get to later. But first, it is to show to college students,
particularly Computer Science students and other engineers that are inclined to
remain in their own little bubble, that student government can be impactful and
rewarding. It turns out that collecting student feedback, writing a resolution,
and delivering both to the administration can be really effective. And the
faculty, staff, and administrators actually care about what we say. As a member
of the USG executive committee, I see firsthand that we receive responses within
hours of sending out a resolution, set up meetings within a couple weeks, and
see action the same month. I was a bit sceptical of this when I joined, but
I have since seen that students come first not only for the USG, but also for
most faculty, staff, and administrators.

So, if you are a student at CWRU, I would encourage you to run. Letters of
intent are closed for this election cycle, but openings almost always come up as
some representatives have to resign. Keep an eye on the USG newsletter for
opportunities to run. And if you do not want to be a representative, you are
alway welcome at GA and any committee meetings.

To The Point, part 2
===
The second point is to announce my candidacy for re-election to the position of
VP of IT. I recognize that since I am running unopposed, I do not need to
campaign, but I would like to get the word out about the elections. To CWRU
students: vote on April 6th and 7th! The USG represents you, and this is your
first chance to impact how we do so for the next year.

I am not going to restate my full letter of intent here; you can read that [on
the USG website](http://usg.case.edu/election_letters_16s) (just scroll down
a bit).
