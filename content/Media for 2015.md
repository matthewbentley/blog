As 2015 gets under way, I want to give my readers an idea of where I like to get my news and entertainment.  As you might notice, many of these are podcasts.  Podcasts are great because I can listen to them while walking between classes.

I will periodically update this list if I add anything new to my news + entertainment consumption list.  I will probably re-post this on social media if I make any large changes, so no need to check it too often.  Just [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/matteotom).
