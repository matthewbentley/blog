About
-----
Hi.  My name is Matthew Bentley.  I am currently (as of March 2016) a student at Case Western Reserve University.

I generally use this site to write down anything I wish to say that is too long for a couple tweets.  ~~Hopefully, as we move into 2015, that will be at least a couple posts per week.~~ Well, that certainly didnâ€™t happen.

~~Before anyone asks, this site is made with [ghost](https://ghost.org/), using the [Pixeltraveller](https://github.com/matthewbentley/Pixeltraveller) theme.  It is running in the [ghost docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/dockerfile/ghost/) behind nginx on an Ubuntu [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=1f1c0bb1c4c6) droplet.~~  The dns for my domain is hosted with [dns.he.net](http://dns.he.net).  IPv6 support can be added as soon as somebody asks, or when I have time.

I have made a few changes.  This blog now uses [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo), a static site generator, and is hosted on DigitalOcean with FreeBSD using plain nginx.  The Hugo theme is [here](https://github.com/matthewbentley/vienna).  The DNS and IPv6 comments still stand.
