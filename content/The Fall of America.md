I'm writing this primarily as a reference, to which I can point people when I do not have enough time to fully state my opinion on this topic.  Specifically, the topic is the dangers of unrestricted surveillance and the importance of freedom of expression and strong (non-backdoored) cryptography.  The title may be a bit dramatic, but it is appropriate, because I believe that freedom of expression is by far the most important right in a free societ, and eroding it is one of the most dangerous things we can do.

Note that this assumes you are familiar with Snowden's leaks regarding the actions of the [NSA](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files) (and [here](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded# section/1)).
Also note that I will likely update this as I see fit.

# Surveillance
In this context, surveillance is a very wide topic.  At the very least, it covers [wiretapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_tapping), intercepting physical communications (eg mail), collecting data or [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) transmitted over the internet, physical tracking, and any other intercepting and/or collection of what would normally be considered private data.

Of course there are, as there should be, [legal paths to such collection and storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata).  So, unless I specify otherwise, when I talk about surveillance I am refering to surveillance that happens either outside the law or within a law that allows circumvention of the normal (non-[secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court)) court system.

## Chilling effects
A [chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect) happens when a law, the threat of legal action, or really any other threat is used to discourage free speech.  There may be no real substance to the threats, but many bloggers, journalists, and activists cannot afford to fight a lawsuit or a phony conviction.  Under such a senario, a law against even the most extreme, egregious expression could be used to deter what should be protected speach.

## Future considerations
Personally, I think the current administration, as well as the previous and most likely the next, is too incompentant to actually do much harm with mass interception and collection of personal data and communications.  However, I do not trust that future leaders will not try to use it for their own benefit, or for the benefit of a few powerful benefactors.  
Let's take a short hypothetical.  Some time in the near future, things start to get bad in the United States.  Protesting is "temporarily" banned, to help "keep the peace".  Organizing without prior concent is banned.  Previously in history, groups could still organize in secret.  Now, however, the government knows all your habits, everyone you have ever associated with, and has a list of people that might be likely to protest.  Additionally, it would be easy to detect any kind of deviance from normal behaviours that might indicate subversive behaviours.

## "I have nothing to hide"
I hope that starts to demonstrate why "I have nothing to hide" is such a bad idea.  You might not now, but you don't know about the future.  And it is perfectly concievable that normal actions could be misinterpreted if the government does not have full access to everything.
